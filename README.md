# Emotion Detection Using CNN

This project implements real-time facial emotion detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model classifies facial expressions into seven emotions: **Angry**, **Disgust**, **Fear**, **Happy**, **Neutral**, **Sad**, and **Surprise**.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the emotion detector:

    ```bash
    python script.py
    ```

## Model Architecture

The CNN is built with 4 convolutional layers and uses an Adam optimizer with early stopping and model checkpoints.
